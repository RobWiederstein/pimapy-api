# pimapy-api

At the core, this is a kedro + quarto project that uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The project is designed to demonstrate how to build a machine learning pipeline using Kedro and deploy it as an API using FastAPI. Additionally, a Quarto report is generated to visualize the results of the model.
